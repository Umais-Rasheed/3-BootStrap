# 3-BootStrap

Bootstrap is a popular front-end framework that helps developers build responsive and mobile-first websites quickly.
It comes with a grid system, pre-designed components, and CSS styles that make it easy to create responsive web designs.
Here are some key concepts and tips for creating a responsive web design using Bootstrap:

Grid System:

Bootstrap uses a 12-column grid system. You can use classes like col-sm-, col-md-, and col-lg- to specify the number of 
columns a particular element should span based on the screen size.

Responsive Images:

Add the img-fluid class to make images responsive. This ensures that images scale properly based on the size of the viewport.

Navigation Bar:

Use the Bootstrap Navbar component for creating responsive navigation bars. The navigation bar automatically collapses into a 
mobile-friendly toggle button on smaller screens.
html

Responsive Typography:

Bootstrap includes responsive font classes that automatically adjust the font size based on the screen size. For example, use text-sm, text-md, etc.
html

Media Queries:

Bootstrap handles most responsiveness for you, but you can also use custom media queries in your CSS to fine-tune styles based on specific screen sizes.

Utilities:

Bootstrap provides utility classes for hiding or showing elements based on screen size, such as d-none, d-sm-block, etc.
